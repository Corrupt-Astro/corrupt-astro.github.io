        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate and creative individual with a keen interest in programming. I love tackling new challenges and building things from scratch. Outside of coding, you might find me exploring the outdoors or diving into a good book.</p>
        
        <p>I specialize in **Lua coding**, a lightweight, fast, and powerful scripting language. I enjoy using it for everything from game development to creating custom tools and applications. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a great language for bringing ideas to life.</p>
